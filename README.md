**OS- Operating systems- Scheduling Program Group Project**

Priority scheduler- The program is created for a single-player arcade game machine, and uses Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) Scheduling. 
There are two queues, a priority queue for high-priority members and a regular queue for non-members. 
The program avoids indefinite waiting by placing non-members into the priority queue if they have been waiting for too long. 
If the system is occupied for too long, the current player is also required to release the machine and move back to the waiting queue.
