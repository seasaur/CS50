Check out my borders

<p>
This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.
</p>

<p>
The background color is #DCF5F5, and the image file is tiled on top.
</p>

<p>
Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".
<br />
This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.

<hr>
<p>
This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span><span class="fancy"> and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span> because they belong to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.
