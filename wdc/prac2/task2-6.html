<h1>
Check out my borders
</h1>

<p>
We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.
</p>

<p>
Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;
<br />
all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline</span>.
<br />
That prevents it from messing with the line height.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Notice how the borders double up here:
</p>

<span class="red-border">This div has a red border</span>
<span class="blue-border">This div has a blue border</span>

<p>
Notice how this fixes the borders:
</p>
<span class="red-border-edit">This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</span>
<span class="blue-border-edit">This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</span>
</body>
