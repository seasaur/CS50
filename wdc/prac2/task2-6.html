<h1>
Check out my borders
</h1>

<p>
We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.
</p>

<p>
Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".
<br />
This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span><span class="fancy"> and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span> because they belong to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.
