<h1>
Check out my borders
</h1>

<p>
We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.
</p>

<p>
Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;
<br />
all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline</span>.
<br />
That prevents it from messing with the line height.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.
