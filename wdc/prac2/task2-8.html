<h1>
This new heading font is much more elegant
</h1>

<p>
We've updated the font for headings to a more elegant one from Google Fonts: Raleway. Note that for this to not break previous pages, sans-serif should still be present as a fallback.
</p>

<h2>
L2 Heading font is also Raleway
</h2>

<p>
Similarly, the default font is now Noto Serif from Google Fonts.
<br />
Again, for this to not break previous pages, serif should still be present as a fallback.
</p>
<hr>
<q>
This multi-line quote from http://example.example also uses the Raleway font, and is dimgrey with a line-height of 1.5, word-spacing of 0.2em, and justified.
</q>
<p>
Alternatively, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline</span>.
<br />
That prevents it from messing with the line height.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Notice how the borders double up here:
</p>

<div class="red-border">This div has a red border</div>
<div class="blue-border">This div has a blue border</div>

<p>
Notice how this fixes the borders:
</p>
<div class="red-border-edit">This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</div>
<div class="blue-border-edit">This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</div>
