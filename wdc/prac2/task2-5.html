<h1>
A page with some divs and spans
</h1>

<p>
This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.
</p>

<p>
The background color is #DCF5F5, and the image file is tiled on top.
</p>

<p>
Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".
<br />
This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.

<hr>
<p>
This is a normal paragraph, except <span>this span of text is blue</span>
